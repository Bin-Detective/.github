# Bin Detective: “Kenali Jenis Sampahmu”

## Empowering Minds: A Holistic Approach to Education and Personal Development

### Executive Summary / Abstract

Children and teenagers often lack an understanding of the different types of waste and the importance of proper waste segregation, leading to increased improperly managed waste and negative environmental impacts. To address this issue, Bin Detective was developed—a gamified mobile application designed to improve young people’s knowledge and practices in effective waste management.

Through engaging quizzes, educational content, and a reward-based system, Bin Detective seeks to:

- Raise awareness of proper waste management.
- Foster environmentally responsible habits among children and teenagers.
- Contribute to a cleaner and healthier environment by promoting sustainable behaviors in a fun, interactive way.

This project aims to evaluate whether the Bin Detective app can positively influence waste management behaviors and assess its impact on fostering environmentally conscious habits in young users' communities.
