### Executive Summary / Abstract

Children and teenagers often lack an understanding of the different types of waste and the importance of proper waste segregation, leading to increased improperly managed waste and negative environmental impacts. To address this issue, Bin Detective was developed—a gamified mobile application designed to improve young people’s knowledge and practices in effective waste management.

Through engaging quizzes, educational content, and a reward-based system, Bin Detective seeks to:

- Raise awareness of proper waste management.
- Foster environmentally responsible habits among children and teenagers.
- Contribute to a cleaner and healthier environment by promoting sustainable behaviors in a fun, interactive way.

This project aims to evaluate whether the Bin Detective app can positively influence waste management behaviors and assess its impact on fostering environmentally conscious habits in young users' communities.

### How our team come up with Bin Detective
Our team came up with "Bin Detective" after noticing a significant gap in waste management awareness among children and teenagers, which has led to improper waste handling and its environmental impacts. We observed that traditional methods of educating young people about waste segregation were not engaging enough to create lasting habits. Recognizing the potential of gamified learning, we developed "Bin Detective" to make waste management education both fun and impactful. Through interactive quizzes, rewards, and educational content, we aim to empower young users to adopt sustainable practices that benefit their communities and the environment.
